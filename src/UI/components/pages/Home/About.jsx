                <p>Itâ€™s a lot of times we come across victims of sexual abuse accused and not believed when they come out and tell the world what happened to them. Many platforms connecting the youth exist, but the same apps that create a fun environment are also the same apps that can destroy them especially if a sensitive matter is raised and it triggers a past trauma.</p>

            <div className='our-goal'>
                    <h1>our goal</h1>
                    <p>Our part in supporting this youth is creating a safe space for them, where they know that all of them share the same stories and encourages others to speak up without fear of being judged or taken for a liar. We believe that this could help them through sharing, being there for one another, and give them the confidence that they are seen as well as a sense of belonging.
